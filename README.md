# Ames House Prices Prediction
Welcome to my data science project on predicting housing prices using the Ames Housing Dataset from Kaggle. This project aims to develop a model that accurately predicts the prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa based on various features such as the size of the house, the number of rooms, and the condition of the property.

The Ames Housing Dataset is a popular dataset in the field of data science, and it contains information on over 1,400 homes sold between 2006 and 2010. The dataset is diverse, with information on various types of homes, from small apartments to large family homes. In addition, the dataset includes a wide range of features, such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the size of the lot, and the type of foundation.

We will use advanced machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the value of residential homes. The model will be trained on a subset of the Ames Housing Dataset, and then validated on a separate subset to ensure that it is able to generalize well to new data.
